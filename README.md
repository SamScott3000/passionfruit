# Passionfruit

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project deployed on [`Vercel`](https://vercel.com/) with [`Prismic`](https://prismic.io/) integration.

## Features

This site uses ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration), allowing for on the fly edits in Prismic to appear without a full site rebuild.


## Getting Started 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
