            Generic in its current form is a plan for an interactive
            installation examining space as defined by the digital. It grabs and
            displays low quality amateur footage from the user&apos;s input.
            This footage is location restricted based on the destination&apos;s
            nearest airport, meaning an endless cycle of flight footage, airport
            terminals and concrete wastelands are all that&apos;s gets show.
            Generic space seeps into online experience.

            3. The coordinates of the nearest airport closest to the original
            search string are found.These coordinates then inform a video search
            along with keywords to get a list of all travel related videos from
            that location.

            4. These videos are parsed and filtered for orientation, resolution

            5. These videos are then displayed along with their title and total
            viewcount. They are displayed as soon as they are found, meaning
            they are always at risk of change. The smaller display presents
            tourist advert stock footage of sunsets and beaches, with text
            giving you a clue as to where you are.
